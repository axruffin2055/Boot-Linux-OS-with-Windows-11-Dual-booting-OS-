Installation Steps: 

Download openSUSE ISO: 
I chose to install openSUSE Leap.
https://www.opensuse.org/  (Choose Leap or Tumbleweed)

Choose one of the following tools to create a bootable USB:
Rufus (For Windows users installing openSUSE)
Insert USB (8GB or more)  
Download from: https://rufus.ie
Open Rufus
Select: openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso
Partition scheme: GPT  (In the BIOS, if Boot mode is UEFI then gpt. If Legacy then mbr)
File system: ext4, xfs, or btrfs 
Click "Start"

OR

I recommend this one:
Ventoy (For multi-boot users)
Download from: https://ventoy.net
Extract and run Ventoy2Disk.exe
Select USB drive and install Ventoy
Then drag and drop the openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso into the USB

OR

WoeUSB (For Linux users)
Install WoeUSB:
sudo woeusb --target-filesystem NTFS --device /path/to/openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso /dev/sdX

Boot from the USB: 
When you restart or reboot your computer, you need to boot into the USB installer with the  openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso.
Way to boot into USB:
Restart your computer and hold DELETE button then check your BIOS/UEFI boot menu options because
you might need to change the boot order in the BIOS/UEFI settings. 
Or simply
Boot from the USB installer (Ventoy, Rufus, or woeusb) directly by 
Restarting your PC and press F12, Esc, or another key depending on your system

Install openSUSE: 
When the openSUSE installer loads, choose Installation. 

Follow the on-screen prompts, choosing your language, keyboard layout, etc. 

When you reach the Disk Partitioning step, select Custom Partitioning. 

Partition the Disk: 

You will see the unallocated space left from shrinking the Windows partition. 

Create the following partitions for openSUSE: 

/boot (1GB, ext4) – this will store boot files. 

/ (root) (25GB or more, ext4 or XFS) – this will be the root filesystem. 

Swap (size based on your RAM, usually 2-4GB, swap or swap-on-LVM). 

Optionally, you can create /home if you want to keep user data separate. 

Make sure /boot/efi (EFI System Partition) is correctly selected, especially if you're using UEFI boot mode. 

Note: Don’t modify the existing Windows partitions. 

Install Bootloader: 

Ensure that the GRUB bootloader is installed in the EFI partition (/boot/efi). 

GRUB will allow you to choose between Windows 11 and openSUSE at boot. 

Complete Installation: 

After setting up the partitions, proceed with the installation. 

The installer will copy files to the partitions and set up the bootloader. 

Post-Installation: 

Once installation is complete, reboot your computer. 

You should see a GRUB menu at boot, allowing you to select either openSUSE or Windows 11. 

Adjust Boot Order (if necessary): 

If Windows boots automatically without showing the GRUB menu, you might need to change the boot order in the BIOS/UEFI to boot from the EFI partition where GRUB is installed. 

You can also use efibootmgr to modify boot priorities if necessary.
