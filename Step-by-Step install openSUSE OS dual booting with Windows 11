Installation Steps: 

Download openSUSE ISO: 
I chose to install openSUSE Leap.
https://www.opensuse.org/  (Choose Leap or Tumbleweed)

Choose one of the following tools to create a bootable USB:
Rufus (For Windows users installing openSUSE)
Insert USB (8GB or more)  
Download from: https://rufus.ie
Open Rufus
Select: openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso
Partition scheme: GPT  (In the BIOS, if Boot mode is UEFI then gpt. If Legacy then mbr)
File system: ext4, xfs, or btrfs 
Click "Start"

OR

I recommend this one:
Ventoy (For multi-boot users)
Download from: https://ventoy.net
Extract and run Ventoy2Disk.exe
Select USB drive and install Ventoy
Then drag and drop the openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso into the USB

OR

WoeUSB (For Linux users)
Install WoeUSB:
sudo woeusb --target-filesystem NTFS --device /path/to/openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso /dev/sdX

Boot from the USB: 
When you restart or reboot your computer, you need to boot into the USB installer with the  openSUSE-Leap<VERSION>.iso.
Way to boot into USB:
Restart your computer and hold DELETE button then check your BIOS/UEFI boot menu options because
you might need to change the boot order in the BIOS/UEFI settings. 
Or simply
Boot from the USB installer (Ventoy, Rufus, or woeusb) directly by 
Restarting your PC and press F12, Esc, or another key depending on your system

Install openSUSE: 
When the openSUSE installer loads, choose Installation. 
Follow the on-screen prompts, choosing your language, keyboard layout, etc. 
When you reach the Disk Partitioning step, select Custom Partitioning. 

Partition the Disk: 
You will see the unallocated disk space left over after reinstalling Windows 11 or shrinking the Windows partition filesystem. 

Understanding dual booting partition situation for openSUSE:
Normally, for installing an OS we need to create:
/boot/efi         (Store bootloader files and related UEFI boot information)
/boot             (Partition space needed for kernel & initramfs)
/root             (Partition for OS filesystem)
But because we are sharing the disk space with Windows 11 OS, while installing openSUSE, we only need to create the /root partition using LVM:
/boot/efi         (No need to create because Windows 11 and openSUSE OS will share this partition)
/boot             (No need to create because the kernel: vmlinuz file and the initramfs.img : will be stored in openSUSE /root partition)
/root             (Yes, you have to create because the /root will hold /var /home /tmp /swap partitions using LVM)

To Use LVM you must first create a Volume Group (VG) first, then using VG, create each Logical Volume.
When you are creating LV be sure to use the correct mounting points.
Ex: lv_root is the name of my LV /root and it's mount point is (/) 
└─nvme0n1p5                  259:5    0   1.5T  0 part 
  ├─vg_openSUSE-lv_swap      253:4    0     5G  0 lvm  
  ├─vg_openSUSE-lv_home      253:5    0   640G  0 lvm  
  ├─vg_openSUSE-lv_var       253:6    0    50G  0 lvm  
  └─vg_openSUSE-lv_root      253:7    0    90G  0 lvm  

Create the following partitions for openSUSE:
Look around and understand the place that you are at.
Do not modify the existing Windows partitions at all. 
If you are using UEFI boot mode, make sure /boot/efi (EFI System Partition) mounted and is correctly selected. 
Create a volume group while creating your first logical volume 
/root      (25GB or more, filesystem type: btrfs, Role: Operation system) 
/var       (10GB or more, filesystem type: xfs, Role: Data and ISV Applications)
/swap      (2GB or more, filesystem type: swap)
/home      (As much as you want on GB, filesystem type: ext4, Role: Operation system)

After setting up the partitions, proceed with the installation. 
Once installation is complete, reboot your computer. 
Once the computer start up, you should see a GRUB menu at boot startup. This will allow you to select either openSUSE or Windows 11. 

And with that complete your dual booting setup.
Have fun and enjoy.
