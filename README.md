# Boot-Linux-OS-with-Windows-11-(Dual-booting-OS)
Say goodbye to Windows Sub-system for Linux (WSL2).


Introduction: 
If you have Windows 11 and you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), just know, that I feel your pain. I was using Linux kernal 
with Linux's distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu (Just a Linux command line tool). And while it was great using WSL2 as a virtual machine
that mounts Linux Kernal to use distributions for software configurations, package managment, file system interaction, and network enhancements,
I believe half of the problems I experinced with WSL2 would have not exist if I was using an Linux native or Linux OS because even though
Linux is compatible with a wide range of hardware and software, WSL2 is Windows and will not be forgiven on compatibilities because Windows and WSL2
(Linux kernal and distribution) runs side by side. Thus, while Linux compatibility is saying yes on software or hardware, you will run into  
problem with Windows 11 because WLS2 act as a virtual machine or a container.
